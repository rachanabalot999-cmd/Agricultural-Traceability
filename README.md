# Agricultural Traceability

## Overview

Agricultural Traceability is a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology to enable transparent, secure, and tamper-proof tracking of agricultural products from farm to consumer. By providing end-to-end visibility, it ensures product authenticity, improves food safety, and builds trust across the supply chain.

## Key Features

- Unique product tracking using digital and QR-based IDs
- Immutable record of each stage from farm to market
- Consumer access to production and distribution history
- Enhanced food safety and rapid recall management
- Increased transparency and credibility for producers and retailers

## System Flow

1. **Farmers:** Register crops and generate product IDs
2. **Distributors:** Update shipping and handling events
3. **Retailers:** Confirm receipt and provide product information to consumers
4. **Consumers:** Scan QR code to verify product origin and journey

## Technology Stack

- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
- **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum or compatible network
- **Frontend:** React or similar (optional)
- **Tools:** Hardhat, Truffle, or Foundry for development and testing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/agricultural-traceability.git
    cd agricultural-traceability
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
